/**
 * `%%rbac` directives → per-operation access rules.
 *
 * The directive was reserved for a long time: documented, renderer-safe, and
 * read by nobody, so a model could declare `%%rbac role:admin on Order.delete`
 * and every signed-in user could still delete orders. This module is what makes
 * it mean something.
 *
 * ## It restricts; it does not grant
 *
 * An `(entity, operation)` pair carrying no `%%rbac` directive is unrestricted —
 * anyone the session guard admits may perform it. One or more directives turn
 * that pair into a closed list: the caller must hold at least one of the named
 * roles, or a master role.
 *
 * The alternative reading — every operation denied until granted — is the
 * stricter default and the wrong one here. It would silently lock every user
 * out of every existing model on the next regeneration, and a model that says
 * nothing about permissions is a model whose author has not thought about them
 * yet, not one that wants everything forbidden.
 *
 * ## Why this does not write `sys_access`
 *
 * `sys_access` looks like the natural home and is not. It is a *grant* table
 * whose rows feed `sys_refresh_dictionary_scope()`, which recomputes
 * `allowed_roles` on every dictionary table: a table with no `sys_access` rows
 * is visible to all roles, and the first row added narrows it to that role
 * alone. Seeding one from `%%rbac role:admin on Order.delete` would therefore
 * hide the Order window from everybody except admin — a restriction on deleting
 * silently becoming a restriction on looking. The two concerns need two tables,
 * so operation rules live in `sys_operation_access`.
