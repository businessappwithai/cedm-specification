/**
 * The reporting pack, held to the model it claims to be derived from.
 *
 * Three kinds of assertion here, and the second is the one worth having:
 *
 *   - **Shape**: an entity earns a register, an `%%enum` a breakdown, a state
 *     machine a lifecycle, a `oneToMany` a children-per-parent.
 *   - **Agreement with the application.** The pack names tables the generated
 *     application actually creates, and scopes each reporting role to exactly
 *     what `deriveAccess` says the same role may read. The two products came to
 *     disagree about both before this file existed: a table named by a second
 *     snake-casing (`bus_k_y_c_record` against `bus_kyc_record`) and a role
 *     whose count was computed twice.
 *   - **The empty-scope inversion.** `tables: []` means "everything" for an
 *     administrator and "nothing" for every other role, and reading the second
 *     as the first hands the least-privileged account on the system permission
 *     to read the whole schema.
