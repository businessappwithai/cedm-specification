/**
 * Guards against a comment placed among a JSX tag's attributes.
 *
 * A `{...}` comment where an attribute is expected is a parse error, and the
 * failure surfaces a long way from the cause: the route-tree generator gives
 * up, `routeTree.gen.ts` is never written, and the generated app dies at boot
 * on a missing-module error that names neither the file nor the comment. It
 * cost a full debugging pass to find, and nothing else in this repo would have
 * caught it — these files are inert templates here and only become code in
 * someone else's project.
 *
 * This is a structural check, not a parser. No TSX parser is reachable from the
 * test environment: typescript is not resolvable from this package, esbuild is
 * not hoisted, and `Bun` is undefined inside vitest. So it proves exactly one
 * thing — that no comment sits between a tag's attributes — rather than
 * claiming the templates are valid TSX in general. Narrow and true beats broad
 * and unrunnable.
