/**
 * Product analytics — one file, one vendored library, one funnel.
 *
 * The thing worth measuring on this site is not page views. It is how far a
 * visitor gets along a path that happens entirely in their own browser:
 *
 *     try_it_viewed → prompt_copied → model_uploaded → checker_passed
 *                   → generate_succeeded → app_ready → app_interaction
 *
 * Every one of those steps is a real function in `run-in-browser.js` or
 * `validator.js`, so the events are recorded where the step actually happens
 * rather than inferred from a click. Those two files are vendored from
 * `businessappwithai/app-with-ai-tanstack`, so their instrumentation is one
 * greppable line each — `window.awTrack?.(…)` — and every decision about what
 * that line means lives here, in a file this repository owns.
 *
 * `window.awTrack` is defined synchronously, before PostHog has loaded and
 * whether or not it ever does. It queues, and it is a no-op when analytics are
 * off. A caller never has to know which.
 *
 * ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * SETUP — the one thing that has to be filled in
 *
 *   1. Create a project at https://posthog.com (or self-host).
 *   2. Project settings → Project API key. Paste it into `POSTHOG.key` below.
 *   3. If the project is in the EU cloud, change `POSTHOG.host` to
 *      https://eu.i.posthog.com.
 *
 * A project API key is a write-only, publish-safe credential — it is meant to
 * appear in client-side source, and PostHog documents it that way. Nothing else
 * here is a secret. Until the key is set, this file collects nothing at all.
 * ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
