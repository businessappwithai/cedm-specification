/**
 * The page that generates and runs an application without a server.
 *
 * Three moving parts, in order:
 *
 *   1. A model is read — from `models/*.eml.mmd` beside this page, or from a
 *      file the reader picks. Reading a picked file never leaves the tab.
 *   2. `appwithai-wasm.js` compiles it. That bundle is built from the same
 *      source the CLI uses, so the application produced here is the application
 *      `appwithai-wasm generate` would have written.
 *   3. The files are posted to a Service Worker, which serves them as if they
 *      had come off a web server, and an iframe is pointed at the result.
 *
 * The third step is the one worth explaining. The obvious shortcut is to write
 * the application into a blob URL and skip the worker — but then the app's own
 * `fetch("/api/…")` calls have no origin to go to, and the whole property being
 * demonstrated (that this is a server the front end is talking to, not a library
 * it is calling) quietly stops being true. Going through the Service Worker
 * keeps the generated application byte-identical to the one you would deploy.

// The published validator, not the copy inside the generator bundle. Same engine
// either way — but this is the file `llms-full.txt` §1.3 and §8 tell a model to
// validate against, so the page and the protocol cannot drift into disagreeing
// about whether a document is acceptable. `fixer.js` carries the checker with
// it, which is what lets it re-check what it repaired.
//
// Local delta: `../../guide/fixer.js` rather than upstream's `../fixer.js`,
// because this site publishes the validators under `guide/` while this module
// lives under `assets/js/`. Same file, same URL the spec quotes.

 *
 * The fractions come from measuring, and they were badly wrong. Opening

 * spent booting, and seeding took the other 245 — yet the marks gave the first
 * two 70% of the bar and seeding a tenth. That ratio is structural rather than
 * a property of the machine: opening PGlite and running DDL is a fixed cost,
 * while seeding inserts a row at a time and grows with the model. So seeding
 * now owns most of the bar.
 *
 * Matching on the status text is a soft coupling, and deliberately so: an
 * unrecognised status still shows in the detail line and simply does not advance
 * the bar. The alternative — a numbered protocol between the page and the
 * runtime — buys nothing that a stalled bar does not already communicate.
