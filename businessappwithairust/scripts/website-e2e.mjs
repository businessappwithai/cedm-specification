/**
 * Website end-to-end tests.
 *
 * Every claim this site makes about a published model is checked against the
 * model itself, read with the generator's own reader — `viewers/eml-model.js`,
 * the bundle the viewers page runs. Nothing here re-implements the language: if
 * a count is wrong, it is wrong because the page is stale, not because this
 * file counts differently.
 *
 * It exists because three separate defects reached the live site, each of the
 * same shape — a page describing a model it no longer matched, or a vendored
 * bundle that had fallen behind the generator:
 *
 *   1. `try-it-yourself.html` said the hospital model had 28 entities, nine
 *      state machines and 87 access restrictions. It has 30, ten and 132.
 *   2. The same stale figures were repeated in three guide chapters.
 *   3. `assets/js/appwithai-fullstack.js` was months behind the acronym fix, so
 *      the deployable zip named a table `bus_k_y_c_record` while every reader of
 *      the same model called it `bus_kyc_record`. The application built, ran and
 *      answered; only a query written in the model's own words found it.
 *
 * None of those had a test. All three do now.
 *
 *   node scripts/website-e2e.mjs          exit 0 clean, 1 on any failure
 *   node scripts/website-e2e.mjs --verbose  print every assertion, not just failures
 *
 * Node only, no dependencies, in the style of check-spec.mjs beside it.

 * `assistant.html` is the only page here that sends a reader's model to

 * about it are promises rather than implementation details, and each is the
 * kind that rots quietly:
 *
 *   - it runs the ENHANCEMENT protocol. Pointed at the authoring edition it
 *     would rewrite the model it was given, which is the exact failure that
 *     edition exists to prevent — and the page would still look right.
 *   - the key never reaches this origin. The moment anything on this page
 *     posts it somewhere of ours, the warning it prints becomes a lie.
 *   - the warning is above the key field. Below it, a reader has already
 *     pasted by the time they read it.
