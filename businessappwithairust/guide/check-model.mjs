/**
 * check-model.mjs — run the published EML checker over a model file.
 *
 *   curl -sO https://www.appwithai.org/guide/check-model.mjs
 *   node check-model.mjs my-business.mmd
 *
 * §1.3 of https://www.appwithai.org/llms-full.txt asks a language model to validate
 * the `.mmd` it wrote before handing it over, by importing `checker.js` and
 * `fixer.js`. That is one line in Bun or Deno, which import straight from a URL,
 * and it is several in Node, which removed network imports — so a model with a
 * shell and no memory of the difference tends to skip the step. This script is
 * that step, in one command, on every runtime: it finds the published modules,
 * runs the three passes §1.3 describes, prints the report, and exits non-zero if
 * the generator would refuse the model.
 *
 * It is a runner, not a second checker. Every diagnostic it prints comes from
 * `checker.js` and `fixer.js` — the same engines `appwithai` runs.
 *
 * Options
 *   --base <url>   where to load checker.js and fixer.js from — a directory
 *                  works too, which is how to run this with no network at all
 *                  (default: this file's own directory, the working directory,
 *                  ./guide/, then https://www.appwithai.org/guide/)
 *   --write        save the repaired document back over the input file when
 *                  `checkAndFix` repaired something
 *   --quiet        print only the verdict line
 *
 * Exit codes: 0 clean · 1 the checker found errors · 2 the script could not run.

/**
 * Where the published modules live.
 *
 * One host, and deliberately one: `appwithai.org`. This list used to carry two
 * entries described as "two spellings because both answer", the second being
 * the same name under a `www.` label — and that one never answered. Pages issues a
 * certificate for the domain configured in repository settings, so the `www.`
 * label was reached over TLS it did not cover and every client refused it with
 * ERR_CERT_COMMON_NAME_INVALID. A fallback that cannot succeed is not
 * redundancy; it is one wasted round trip before the real error.
 *
 * The redundancy that does work is local-first, below: `--base`, this file's
 * own directory, the working directory, then `./guide/`. `checker.js` and
 * `fixer.js` are two dependency-free ES modules, so anything that puts them on
 * disk — a checkout, a copy, a file the user pastes in — is a complete
 * validation path with no network at all.
 *
 * This is the published site and nothing else. The script deliberately reaches
 * no code-hosting origin: §10.6 of `llmdetailed.txt` tells the reader so, and
 * `scripts/check-spec.mjs` asserts it by reading this file. Failing to reach
 * this host is still not the same as the model being unchecked.

 * running in a sandbox with no egress can put `checker.js` and `fixer.js`
 * beside the model — or `--base ./`, or `--base ./guide/` in a clone of the

 * and a bare `import()` both reject `guide/checker.js` with "Failed to parse
 * URL", which reads as the site being unreachable when the files are sitting
 * right there. So anything without a scheme is resolved against the working
 * directory and handed on as `file:///…/`, and `--base ./` works as documented.
