 * It used to log all three, on the normal path: twenty-four `[ENCRYPTION
 * DEBUG]` lines per call, reporting whether `ENCRYPTION_KEY` was set, its
 * length, whether it was hex, the derived key's length — and, at the end of
 * `decrypt`, the first 200 characters of the plaintext. For a data source that
 * is the whole connection config, so every `docker compose logs` carried
 *
 *     {"host":"…","port":5432,"database":"…","user":"…","password":"…"}
 *
 * in the clear. Storing that config AES-256-GCM encrypted stops meaning
 * anything the moment the plaintext is written to a log, which is collected,
 * shipped and retained by whatever runs the process, usually under far weaker
 * access control than the row it came from.
 *
 * The key-shape lines were the same mistake one step removed: length and
 * character class are exactly what an attacker who has the logs wants to know
 * before attacking the key.
 *
 * What survives is the one line that was load-bearing — the warning that no key
 * is configured and a hard-coded development key is in use — and the failure
 * path, which reports that decryption failed without reproducing either input.
