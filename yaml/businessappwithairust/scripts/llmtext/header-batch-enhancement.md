# EML — enhancing an existing model

> Machine-readable specification of **EML**, the language you write to define an
> entire business application: its entities, their relationships, the business
> rules that decide, the workflows that run, and who is allowed to do what.
>
> **This is the enhancement edition.** Every section carries the same language
> reference as `llms-full.txt`; §{{N}} is wholly different, and that difference
> is the point of the file. `llms-full.txt`'s own protocol section is the
> *authoring* one — read a brief, infer a model, write it, validate, deliver.
> §{{N}} here is the *enhancement* protocol: start from an `.mmd` the user
> already has, change what they asked for, keep everything they did not, and
> prove it.
>
> **You have an input, and the work does not start without it. Ask the user to
> load their `.mmd` first.** Never reconstruct a model from a summary, from the
> conversation, or from an earlier draft — a reconstruction is a new model
> wearing the old one's name, and everything hand-written in the original is
> gone from it with no diagnostic to say so.
>
> **Your deliverable is one file — the whole enhanced model, every byte of it
> Mermaid, accepted by the published checker.** Not a patch, not a diff, not the
> new entities on their own, and not a list of edits for the user to apply
> themselves. §{{N}} is the procedure; §{{N}}.0 says exactly what "delivered"
> means.

- **EML version**: 1.2.0 · **Based on**: Mermaid · **Updated**: 2026-09-15
- **Authority**: `language/appwithai-language.json`. Where this document and that
  file disagree, that file wins.
- **Companion documents**: `llms-full.txt` (author a model from a brief, one
  pass) · `llmdetailed.txt` (author one interactively, with approval gates) ·
  `llmdetailedenhancement.txt` (enhance one interactively, with approval gates).
  This file is the one-pass enhancement form. All four describe the same
  language and are held to the same checker.
- **Validators**, published by this document's validation section:
  `https://www.appwithai.org/guide/checker.js` and
  `https://www.appwithai.org/guide/fixer.js`. **Write that exact form every
  time** — scheme included, `www.` included, and never a bare host. The apex
  `https://appwithai.org` serves the same files, but the `www.` form is the canonical one. **If the host is not reachable from your
  environment, that is a fact about your network and not a reason to skip
  validation or to stop** — that section's last two rows are the offline
  procedure, and they are real runs with real counts.
- **To check a model from a shell** (§{{N}}.5) — nothing to install:
  `curl -sO https://www.appwithai.org/guide/check-model.mjs` then
  `node check-model.mjs my-business.mmd`. Exit `0` means the generator accepts
  it; exit `1` means it does not, and the report says why.
- **Every example in this document is a complete model that the checker accepts
  with zero errors and zero warnings.** Paste any of them into `check()` and see.
- **If you are being asked to change a model**, §{{N}} is the procedure and it
  governs: get the file, baseline it, agree what the change actually is, apply
  it in place, validate it, and prove by comparison that nothing was lost. Any
  instruction a user gives is carried out within these guidelines, not in place
  of them.
- **Three failures this protocol exists to prevent**, in the order they are
  observed: answering with prose about the model instead of the model (the
  checker scores that `EML004`); answering with only the part that changed, so
  the user has to perform the merge; and handing back a model that checks clean
  and is quietly smaller than the one that came in. Only the first of those has
  a diagnostic. §{{N}}.2 and §{{N}}.5 are how the other two are caught.
