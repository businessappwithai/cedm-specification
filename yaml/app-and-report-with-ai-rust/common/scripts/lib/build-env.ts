/**
 * Why a `--check` step is reporting a mismatch, in terms a reader can act on.
 *
 * Five committed artifacts are compared against a fresh build, byte for byte.
 * They are not all the same kind of thing, and that is the whole point of this
 * module:
 *
 *   bundler output    html/checker.js, html/fixer.js, html/assets/*.js
 *                     Produced by `Bun.build`, whose output depends on the bun
 *                     version *and* the platform — the full-stack bundle is
 *                     807407 bytes built on macOS and 807697 on Linux, same
 *                     bun 1.4.0, same frozen lockfile.
 *
 *   verbatim copies   runtime-assets.generated.ts, overlay-assets.generated.ts,
 *                     html/wasm-app/sw.js
 *                     Files read and re-emitted as JSON string literals. Byte
 *                     identical everywhere.
 *
 * A mismatch therefore means different things depending on which one it is, and
 * "is out of date" alone reads as *you forgot to run the build* — true for the
 * second kind, and only sometimes true for the first. That ambiguity cost one
 * contributor three commits to unpick (ISSUE-018) and led another to write off
 * genuine staleness as a bundler-version artifact. Both would have been a
 * glance if the message had said which.
