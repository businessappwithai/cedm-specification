/**
 * Prove the derived reporting pack actually runs against the schema the
 * generator emits.
 *
 * For each model: generate the application, apply its `bus_` migrations to a
 * real PostgreSQL, derive the reporting pack, and execute every query in it.
 *
 * This is the only check that can catch the class of bug the pack is most
 * exposed to. `reporting-pack.ts` builds SQL from a *parsed model*, while the
 * tables come from a *separate compiler* in another project; nothing type-checks
 * one against the other. A column the generator renames, a foreign key it
 * places on the other side of a relationship, an audit column it stops
 * emitting — each leaves the pack building cleanly and every report failing at
 * run time, in an application the person who wrote the model never sees fail.
 *
 * It found one on its first run: the parser's `relationship.foreignKey` names
 * the *target* entity's own id, so `Team ||--o{ User` reads `user_id` rather
 * than the `team_id` column the migration actually creates. Every
 * children-per-parent report was silently absent.
 *
 *   PGHOST=/var/run/postgresql PGPORT=5432 PGUSER=postgres bun scripts/check-reporting-pack.ts
 *
 * Skips itself with a clear message when no PostgreSQL is reachable, so a
 * checkout without one still runs the rest of `bun run check`. Pass
 * `--require-server` to make that a failure instead: CI does, because a check
 * that quietly passes when its database never came up is indistinguishable
 * from one that ran, and the whole point of this file is to not be that.
