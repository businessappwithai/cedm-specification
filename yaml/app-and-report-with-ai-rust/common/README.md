# app-and-report-with-ai-rust

Two products and one modelling language. This repository is the **orchestrator**:
it holds the language, and the pieces that compose the two products into one
running system. It does not hold either product — both are separate
repositories, checked out on demand at the commits `../deps.json` pins.

| | What it is | Repository |
|---|---|---|
| **APPWITHAI** | An AI-assisted ERD designer and full-stack code generator. One Mermaid document describes the data, the decisions and the processes; the generator compiles all three into a running application — a **Loco.rs (Rust)** backend behind a TanStack Start + Astryx front end | [businessappwithai/app-with-ai-rust](https://github.com/businessappwithai/app-with-ai-rust) |
| **Enterprise Reporting** | A multi-datasource analytics platform: connect external databases, ask questions in natural language, and publish the answers as reports, charts, dashboards and scheduled deliveries. Its API, workers, scheduler and seeder are a **Loco.rs (Rust)** backend; its TanStack Start front end renders pages | [businessappwithai/enterprise_reporting_rust](https://github.com/businessappwithai/enterprise_reporting_rust) |

**The server side is Rust throughout.** This repository used to compose the
TanStack/NestJS pair (`app-with-ai-tanstack`, `enterprise_reporting_tanstack`);
it now pins their Rust implementations, and nothing it runs serves an API from
JavaScript except the reporting platform's CopilotKit runtime.

**Neither product is vendored here.** This repository is the orchestrator: it
holds the language, the glue and nothing else. Both are checked out on demand at
the commits `../deps.json` pins:

```bash
../deps.sh --install     # place both beside common/, at their pinned commits
../deps.sh --status      # what is checked out, and whether it matches
```

Both read the same language, and everything that is neither product lives in
`common/`, one level up from this file:

```

`language/appwithai-language.json` is the canonical definition. Each product
repository keeps its own copy for its own CI — `app-with-ai-rust/language/`
under the same name, and `enterprise_reporting_rust/language/` as an older
fork called `erdwithai-language.json`. **All three have drifted from each other,
and when any of them disagrees with this copy, this copy is the language.**

They were once meant to be byte-identical, and this file said so. They are not:
at the pinned commits the two `appwithai-language.json` files differ from line 11
on, and nothing checks them against each other. Only the two copies of the shared
*example models* are held byte-identical, by `check:models` — see **Checks**
below.

## Running both, from one model

```bash
./deps.sh --install                           # once — both products, at their pins
./start.sh                                    # the reference CRM model
./start.sh common/examples/my-app.eml.mmd     # any other model
./start.sh my-app.eml.mmd --profile prod      # two database servers
```

`start.sh` refuses to run without the checkouts, and says which one is missing:
without them the generate fails on a module it cannot resolve and compose fails
on a build context that does not exist, both a long way in and neither error
naming what is actually absent.

Then:

| | |
|---|---|
| http://localhost/ | opens the application (a redirect to `/app/`) |
| http://localhost/app | the application generated from the model — its Loco backend answers `/app/api/` |
| http://localhost/report | the reporting platform, already holding that application's schema as a data source and its reports, charts and dashboard — its Loco backend answers `/report/api/` |
| http://localhost/accounts | the accounts for both applications, one pair per role |

The first `up` compiles both Rust backends inside their images, which takes
several minutes; later builds reuse the dependency layers. No Rust toolchain is
needed on the machine running `start.sh`.

`start.sh` checks the model, generates the application, puts both applications on
their URL prefix, derives the reporting pack from the model, and brings the stack
up. `stop.sh` takes it down; `stop.sh --volumes` discards the databases too.
Everything it writes goes under `common/.runtime/`, which is not checked in.

**The two profiles.** `demo` (the default) runs one pgvector PostgreSQL 16
holding three databases — the application's, `enterprise_config`, and
`ers_knowledge`. `prod` runs two servers, each the image its application actually
asks for: pgvector on PostgreSQL 18 for the generated application, Apache AGE on
16 for the reporting platform. pgvector rather than Apache AGE in the demo is a
forced choice, not a preference: no published image carries both extensions, and
pgvector is the one that is not optional — AGE serves only the reporting
platform's knowledge-graph feature, which is lazy. Under both profiles, the
reporting platform's configuration
never shares a database with the application it reports on — regenerating the
application drops and recreates its tables, and the reports have to survive that.

**Where the reports come from.** `common/build/reporting-pack.ts` derives a
baseline from structure: a register per entity, a breakdown per `%%enum`-bound
column, a lifecycle per state machine in the diagram's own order, children per
`oneToMany`. That baseline describes the shape of the data and nothing about the
business running on it — so a model can also carry `%%report` directives, each a
question its users actually ask written as the SQL that answers it. Those are
listed first and take the top of the dashboard. See
`website/llmtext/llmdetailed.txt` §10.5.1.

## One model, three targets

```bash
bun language/checker.ts examples/analytics-reporting.eml.mmd

# A dependency-free prototype
bun language/cli/eml.ts generate -i <model> -o ./out --stack node-rest

# The whole application: a Loco.rs (Rust) backend crate, TanStack Start + Astryx front end
bun language/cli/eml.ts generate -i <model> -o ./out --stack tanstack-astryx-loco

# Entities for the reporting platform: server functions, routes, a Kysely migration
bun language/cli/eml.ts generate -i <model> -o ./out --stack enterprise-reporting
```

The three differ in what they write, never in what they understand — all of them
read the same parsed model. They do not reach equally far into the language, and
the `enterprise-reporting` target reaches least on purpose: that repository
already holds auth, two layers of RBAC, an encrypted connection manager, an
NL→SQL pipeline, a job runner and a UI shell, so the target emits only what a new
entity needs. It does **not** compile workflows or `%%rbac` — see
`language/README.md` for the coverage table, and the `README.md` the target
writes beside its output for the integration steps.

## The two shipped CLIs

`eml.ts` above is this repository's CLI. APPWITHAI publishes two binaries of its
own, and they are not the same entry point — different argument parsing and
different defaults:

```bash
# The whole application, from the TypeScript pipeline
bun app-with-ai-rust/packages/generator/src/cli/generate.ts \
    generate -i <model> -o ./out --force --skip-cli-scaffold

# The generator's Rust rewrite — the backend crate only, byte for byte the same
cd app-with-ai-rust && cargo run -p appwithai-gen -- \
    generate -i <model> -o ./out --force --skip-cli-scaffold
```

`bun run check:clis` runs both and checks what each produced rather than only
that it exited 0. `check:cli` and `check:cli:rust` run one each; CI gives the
Rust one its own job, because it is the only check that needs a Rust toolchain.
`--skip-cli-scaffold` skips `loco new`, which only contributes the framework's
own CI workflow, rustfmt config and AGENTS.md.

Add `--no-setup` to the full-stack CLI to stop after writing files. Without it
the CLI goes on to install, migrate and seed against a PostgreSQL server on
127.0.0.1, which is the right default for someone generating an application to
run and not what a check wants.

## One docker, or two

Both applications run under one `docker-compose.yml`, and the profile decides
how far apart they sit:

| | |
|---|---|
| `demo` (default) | One PostgreSQL 16 holding three databases — the generated application's, the platform's `enterprise_config`, and its `ers_knowledge`. One container, one image to pull |
| `prod` | A server per application, each the image it actually asks for: pgvector on PostgreSQL 18 for the generated application, Apache AGE on 16 for the reporting platform |

The application containers are separate under both — the generated Loco backend
and its front end, the reporting platform's Loco backend and its front end, and
the one-shot Rust seeder, behind one nginx on port 80. What the profile changes is the databases. And under both, the
reporting platform's configuration never shares a database with the application
it reports on: regenerating the application drops and recreates its tables, and
the reports have to survive that.

Each product repository keeps its own `CLAUDE.md`, and that is the authority on
that project's commands, conventions and CI — read it in the checkout `./deps.sh`
placed, not from memory. `../CLAUDE.md` is the authority on this repository and
on how the two are run together.

## Where this repository knowingly differs from the product

`deps.sh` places a checkout; it does not make the copies agree. Three
divergences are deliberate and are recorded here so nobody "fixes" them back.
`/sync-downstream` is the procedure for carrying a generator commit across; this
is the list of things that procedure must *not* flatten.

**The product's language JSON contradicts itself about `icon`, and this copy
does not.** `applicationDictionary.alsoDerived` in
`app-with-ai-tanstack/language/appwithai-language.json` still reads *"validated
but not yet compiled … an entity's icon is not taken from the model"*, while its
own `%%entity` entry three keys away says `icon:` compiles to `sys_table.icon`.
`fe4ff9d` wrote the first; `ffed835` reversed it and left that line standing.
This copy carries the fact rather than the contradiction: `icon` is compiled,
the model sets the default and Application Dictionary → Table and Column keeps
the last word. When the two disagree about the language, **this copy is the
language** — and that is the case it was written for.

**A product change to `llmdetailed.txt` fails the site's own spec check.**
`7e6ced3` rewrote the bare-host counter-example as
`[www.appwithai.org](https://www.appwithai.org)`. The site's `check-spec.mjs`
held the apex spelling verbatim, because the bullet exists to *show* a link
around a bare host and so has to be excluded from the scan that forbids one —
so re-vendoring that document made it fail a check about a rule it obeys, on
the very line that teaches the rule. Both spellings are the same lesson and
both are true, so the check now accepts either rather than either document
being edited to suit it. The vendored copy keeps the product's wording; this
repository's own bases keep theirs.

**The published hospital model is not the product's hospital model.**
`app-with-ai-tanstack/examples/hospital-management-system.mmd` (1057 lines)
gained 28 `%%entity icon:` lines, and `common/examples/` twins *that* file, so
it has them too. The 1771-line `hospital-management-system.eml.mmd` the site and
this repository publish is a different document — the one rebuilt through the
interactive protocol — and it has no entity icons. Adding them would be
authoring, not syncing, and nothing checks the two against each other.

Every `icon:` in every model here and on the site does resolve: 189 names
checked against lucide 1.47.0's 2112 ids, through the same `normalizeIconName`
the generated front end uses (`icon.tsx` — it hyphenates before a digit, so
`Building2` is `building-2` and valid), 0 invalid. A wrong name is not a
diagnostic — the checker does not carry lucide's catalogue — so this is the
only thing that would catch one.

## Checks

This folder has its own manifest and its own checks, separate from either
product's:

```bash
bun install
bun run check            # models, types, lint, every stack, both CLIs, and the reporting SQL
```

| | |
|---|---|
| `check:models` | Every model in `language/examples/` and `examples/` checks clean, and `html/models/` is still byte-identical to its counterpart |
| `type-check` | `language/**`, `build/**` and `scripts/**` under the strict config (`tsconfig.language.json`) |
| `lint` | Biome over `language/` and `scripts/` |
| `check:stacks` | All three `--stack` targets actually generate |
| `check:clis` | Both shipped binaries generate, and wrote what each should. `check:cli` / `check:cli:rust` run one each — CI uses those, so the cargo one gets its own toolchain |
| `check:pack` | Every query in every model's reporting pack runs against a **real** generated schema — the `bus_` DDL lifted out of the Loco crate's `m0002_bus_tables` migration. Skips itself with a message when no PostgreSQL is reachable |

**Every one of these needs `../deps.sh` to have run.** Two modules under
`language/cli` import from `app-with-ai-rust` — the shipped JDM converter
and the flowchart parser — and `jdm.ts` does it unconditionally, on every
generation path. Without that checkout `type-check` reports TS2307 and *all
three* stack targets fail at module resolution, not just the heavy one.

`check:stacks` and `check:clis` additionally need that workspace's own
dependencies installed (`../deps.sh --install`): `tanstack-astryx-loco` and the
`appwithai` binary drive the pipeline, which resolves `zod` and the rest from
there; `appwithai-gen` needs cargo. Pass `--skip-heavy` to run only the two self-contained targets:

```bash
bun scripts/check-stacks.ts --skip-heavy
```

## CI

`.github/workflows/` holds two workflows:

| | |
|---|---|
| `root-ci.yml` | `paths:`-filtered to `common/**`, `deps.json` and the scripts that run the two together. A `resolve` job reads `deps.json`, then four jobs check out `app-with-ai-rust` against it and run models/types/lint, every `--stack` target plus the `appwithai` CLI, the `appwithai-gen` CLI with a Rust toolchain, and the reporting pack against a real PostgreSQL |
| `build-and-run.yml` | The orchestrator, on `workflow_dispatch` and nightly. Checks out both products at their pins, generates an application, injects configuration, brings the stack up, and proves `/app` and `/report` answer — content types included, and both APIs answered by Rust, via `common/build/smoke.sh` — and that the seeder exited 0 |

`rust-cli` is a job of its own because it is the only one that needs a Rust
toolchain; every other job runs on bun alone.

Both workflows read the pins from `deps.json` and nowhere else — no workflow
restates a ref in a `with:` block, which is how pins drift. Each product's own CI
lives in its own repository, where the code is. That also means `paths:` cannot
watch them: a change to `app-with-ai-rust` does not trigger a run here, and
the nightly `build-and-run` is what notices instead.
