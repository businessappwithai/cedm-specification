/**
 * The Service Worker — this application's HTTP layer.
 *
 * Two jobs, and the second is the one that makes the first worth doing.
 *
 * It serves the application's own files. When the app was written to disk by
 * the CLI they are already on a static server and this passes straight through;
 * when it was generated inside the browser there is no server, and the files
 * arrive here as a message and are served out of Cache Storage. Same app, same
 * URLs, whichever way it was built.
 *
 * And it forwards `/api/…` to the backend Worker. That is what makes the
 * backend a server rather than a library the UI happens to call: the frontend
 * issues ordinary `fetch("/api/bus/order")` requests to its own origin, and
 * something else entirely answers them. Nothing in the UI knows the difference,
 * which is the property that would let this application be pointed at a real
 * server by deleting this file.
 *
 * One worker can host several applications at once, keyed by base path — which
 * is what the hosted generator needs, and costs nothing here.
