# Record lifecycles

A lifecycle is the set of states a record can be in and the moves between them. The application enforces it on every write, through the screen and through the API: a move the diagram does not draw is refused for everyone, administrators included. Role restrictions narrow who may make a particular move. This application has **11** lifecycles.
