# Record lifecycles

A lifecycle is the set of states a record can be in and the moves between them. The application enforces it on every write, through the screen and through the API: a move the diagram does not draw is refused for everyone, administrators included. Role restrictions narrow who may make a particular move. This application has **12** lifecycles.


## Party: Party lifecycle

States: **Active**, **Inactive**, **Blocked**, **Retired**. A new record starts as **Active**; **Retired** ends the lifecycle.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
  [*] --> ACTIVE
  ACTIVE --> INACTIVE: deactivate
  INACTIVE --> ACTIVE: reactivate
  ACTIVE --> BLOCKED: block
  BLOCKED --> ACTIVE: unblock
  ACTIVE --> RETIRED: retire
  INACTIVE --> RETIRED: retire
  BLOCKED --> RETIRED: retire
```

Any role that may change the record may make any move the diagram draws.


See [Party](/entities/foundation/party/) for the record itself.

## Organization: Organization lifecycle
