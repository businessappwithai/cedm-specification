/**
 * The EML checker, as one file a web page can load.
 *
 * `language/checker.ts` is a Bun command: it reads a `.mmd` off disk, writes a
 * `.mmd.error` beside it and prints in colour. None of that is the checking.
 * The checking is `checkSource` — a string in, a list of diagnostics out — and
 * it has been exported for exactly this reason since the WASM generator needed
 * to refuse a broken model before compiling it.
 *
 * So this file adds no rules. It injects the language definition (a tab has no
 * `appwithai-language.json` to open, so the bundler inlines the same JSON the
 * CLI reads) and re-exports the pure half under names a caller who has never
 * seen this repository can guess. A model checked at appwithai.org/checker.js
 * gets the same diagnostics `bun language/checker.ts` prints, because it is the
 * same engine — the alternative, a second weaker checker written for the web,
 * is how a document comes to pass in one place and fail in the other.
