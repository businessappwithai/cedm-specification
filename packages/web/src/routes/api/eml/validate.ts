/**
 * What a `.mmd` document actually contains.
 *
 * Used before a model is accepted into a project. Someone importing a file
 * wants to know what they are about to get — how many entities, how many rules,
 * which workflows — and, more importantly, to be told *now* if the document is
 * not a model at all, rather than discovering it on the design page with an
 * empty canvas and no explanation.
 *
 * This reads the document; it does not run the full checker. The generator does
 * that at generate time, where a diagnostic can name a line and refuse to
 * proceed. Here the question is narrower: is this a model, and what is in it.
