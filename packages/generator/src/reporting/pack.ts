/**
 * The reporting pack — a generated application's reporting layer, derived.
 *
 * The Enterprise Reporting platform stores reports, charts and dashboards as
 * definitions over saved SQL queries, and it holds roles that decide which
 * tables a reporting user's queries may touch. This turns a parsed model into
 * exactly those definitions, so an application arrives with a reporting layer
 * built for *its* entities instead of an empty workspace and a SQL editor.
 *
 * Nothing here is invented. Every query is derived from something the model
 * actually declares, and a model that declares less gets a smaller pack:
 *
 *   entity                → a register: what rows exist, newest first
 *   enum-bound column     → a breakdown: how the rows divide, as a chart
 *   created_at            → volume by month, as a line
 *   kind: state workflow  → a lifecycle report over the states the diagram
 *                           declares, in the diagram's order, zeroes included
 *   numeric columns       → a measures report, grouped by the entity's own
 *                           primary enum column where it has one
 *   oneToMany             → children per parent, ranked
 *   report                → the author's own question, listed first
 *
 * The *names and descriptions* come from each entity's and column's `help` —
 * the only place a model says what an entity is for rather than what shape it
 * is. That is the difference between a report called "bus_account by status"
 * and one called "Accounts by status" that explains what an account is in this
 * business. A model with no help text still produces a working pack; it just
 * produces one named after tables.
 *
 * ## Why this lives here
 *
 * It was written in `app-and-report-with-ai-tanstack`, where docker-compose
 * stands the real platform up beside a deployed application. That is still the
 * only place the *platform* runs — but the pack it consumes is a pure reading
 * of a model, and two more readers now need it: the browser stack, which serves
 * the same reports and roles from its own runtime, and the full-stack project,
 * which ships the pack in its `reporting/` directory for the platform its
 * compose file starts. Deriving it three times would be three answers to "what
 * reports does this model have". The orchestrator imports this module.
 *
 * Pure, and deliberately so — no `node:fs`, no clock, no database. The browser
 * bundle reaches it.
