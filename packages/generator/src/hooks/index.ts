/**
 * A model's `hooks` → generated lifecycle handlers.
 *
 * A hook flow is how a reader sees the lifecycle; the model's `hooks` are what
 * the generated application runs. Hooks were once stored faithfully in the
 * model and dropped at generation time — `getHooks()` in the generated backend
 * always returned `{}`, so a model could declare `beforeCreate hashPassword` on
 * User and the generated app would silently do nothing.
 *
 * This module validates the declared hooks against the entities the model
 * declares and hands the generator a list it can turn into handler modules and
 * a registry.
