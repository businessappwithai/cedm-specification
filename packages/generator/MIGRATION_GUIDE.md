# Two-Phase Generation Migration Guide

## Summary of Changes

This guide explains the migration from **single-phase template generation** to the new **two-phase CLI + template generation** approach.

## What Changed

### Architecture

    ↓
Template Engine (Handlebars)
    ↓
Generated Application
```

**After (Two-Phase):**
```
ERD Input
    ↓
[Phase 1] Official CLI Scaffolding (nest new / bun create tanstack-start)
    ↓
Base Project with Framework Best Practices
    ↓
[Phase 2] Template Overlay (Custom Code Generation)
    ↓
Complete Generated Application
```

### File Structure Changes

#### Backend (`packages/generator/src/generators/tanstackjs-nestjs/nestjs-backend.generator.ts`)

**Key Method Changes:**
- ❌ Removed: `createDirectoryStructure()` - Manual directory creation
- ✅ Added: `scaffoldNestJsProject()` - Runs NestJS CLI
- ✅ Added: `createAdditionalDirectories()` - Creates custom structure on top
- 🔄 Renamed: `generateConfigFiles()` → `updateConfigFiles()` - Now enhances CLI config

**Generation Flow:**
```typescript
// OLD: Direct template application
async generate() {
  await this.createDirectoryStructure(outputDir);
  await this.prepareContext();
  await this.generateCoreFiles();
  // ... more generation steps
}

// NEW: CLI + Template overlay
async generate() {
  await this.scaffoldNestJsProject(outputDir);      // Phase 1
  const context = this.prepareContext();
  await this.createAdditionalDirectories(outputDir);
  await this.generateCoreFiles(outputDir, context); // Phase 2
  // ... more generation steps
}
```

#### Frontend (`packages/generator/src/generators/tanstackjs-nestjs/nextjs-frontend.generator.ts`)

**Key Method Changes:**
- ❌ Removed: `createDirectoryStructure()` - Manual directory creation
- ✅ Added: `scaffoldTanStackProject()` - Runs TanStack Start CLI
- ✅ Added: `createAdditionalDirectories()` - Creates custom structure on top
- 🔄 Renamed: `generateConfigFiles()` → `updateConfigFiles()` - Now enhances CLI config

**Note:** Environment variable names updated:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` → `VITE_API_URL` (TanStack Start uses Vite)
- Added `VITE_MASTRA_URL` for AI service integration

### New Utilities

#### CLI Executor (`packages/generator/src/utils/cli-executor.ts`)

A new utility class for safe CLI command execution:

```typescript
// Synchronous execution
CliExecutor.executeSync('command', ['arg1', 'arg2'], options);

// Asynchronous execution (recommended)
await CliExecutor.executeAsync('command', ['arg1', 'arg2'], options);

// Check availability
if (CliExecutor.isCommandAvailable('nest')) { ... }

// Get version
const version = CliExecutor.getCommandVersion('nest');

// Directory operations
await CliExecutor.removeDirectory(path);
await CliExecutor.copyDirectory(src, dest);
```

## Dependencies

### New Requirements

The new two-phase generation requires CLI tools to be available:

**NestJS Backend:**
```bash
# Option 1: Global installation
npm install -g @nestjs/cli

# Option 2: Use through bunx (no installation needed)
bunx nest new project-name
```

**TanStack Start Frontend:**
```bash
# Available through bun (no separate installation needed)
bun create tanstack-start@latest project-name
```

### No New npm Dependencies

The generator itself doesn't require new npm dependencies:
- Uses Node.js built-in `child_process` module
- No need to update `packages/generator/package.json` (apart from normal updates)

## Migration Steps

### For End Users

1. **Update generator package** - Pull latest code changes
2. **Install CLI tools (optional):**
   ```bash
   npm install -g @nestjs/cli
   # TanStack Start is available via bun automatically
   ```
3. **Regenerate projects** - Use the generator as normal
4. **Compare outputs** (optional):
   - Run old generator on a copy of project
   - Run new generator and compare structures
   - Both should produce functional applications

### For Framework Maintainers

If you maintain this generator:

1. **Update templates** - Ensure they work with both phases:
   ```handlebars
   {{!-- These templates now overlay on CLI scaffold --}}
   {{!-- Make sure they don't conflict with framework defaults --}}
   ```

2. **Handle graceful degradation** - Phase 1 can fail, Phase 2 should still work:
   ```typescript
   try {
     await this.scaffoldNestJsProject(outputDir);
   } catch (error) {
     console.warn('Phase 1 failed, continuing with Phase 2');
     // Phase 2 creates missing directories as fallback
   }
   ```

3. **Test both phases**:
   - ✅ Test Phase 1 CLI scaffolding independently
   - ✅ Test Phase 2 template overlay independently
   - ✅ Test both phases together
   - ✅ Test Phase 1 failure handling

## Configuration Changes

### Environment Variables

**Frontend (.env.local)**

```diff
- NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3000
+ VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3000
+ VITE_MASTRA_URL=http://localhost:4111
  PORT=3001
```

### package.json Updates

The generator now **enhances** the CLI scaffold's package.json instead of replacing it:

```json
{
  "name": "my-project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "type": "module",
  "dependencies": {
    "@nestjs/common": "^10.0.0",          // From Phase 1 (NestJS CLI)
    "@nestjs/core": "^10.0.0",            // From Phase 1
    "@nestjs/fastify": "^10.0.0",         // Added by Phase 2
    "kysely": "^0.27.0",                   // Added by Phase 2
    "better-auth": "^0.21.0"              // Added by Phase 2
  },
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node dist/main",             // From Phase 1
    "start:dev": "nest start --watch",     // From Phase 1
    "build": "nest build",                 // From Phase 1
    "migrate": "bun run migrate",          // Added by Phase 2
    "seed": "bun run seed"                 // Added by Phase 2
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting Migration

### Issue: CLI commands not found

**Error:**
```
❌ Command failed: nest new my-project
Error: Command not found
```

**Solution:**
```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g @nestjs/cli

# Or let bunx handle it automatically
bunx nest new my-project
```

### Issue: Different generated output

Generated projects might look slightly different due to updated framework versions. This is expected and beneficial:

**Why:**
- Phase 1 uses latest stable CLI versions
- Your old generator might have used older template versions
- New versions have better practices and more features

**Validation:**
1. Check `package.json` dependencies - should have latest versions
2. Verify project builds: `bun install && bun run build`
3. Run tests: `bun run test`
4. Test the app locally

### Issue: Existing generated projects

**Q: Do I need to regenerate all existing projects?**

A: No, existing projects will continue to work. However, you can optionally regenerate to:
- Get latest framework versions
- Benefit from CLI-provided configurations
- Have cleaner default project structure

**Migration Path:**
```bash
# Backup existing project
cp -r my-project my-project.backup

# Create new project with two-phase generation
bun run generate:tanstack  # or your generation command

# Compare structures
diff -r my-project my-project.backup

# If new version is better, use it; otherwise keep backup
```

### Issue: a project generated before the connection-pool fix

This is the one case where "existing projects continue to work" needs a
qualification. `config/*.yaml` is generated once and then checked into the
project, so a project generated earlier keeps whatever defaults were current on
the day it was generated — a later generator release cannot reach back into it.

Projects generated before that fix carry `connect_timeout: 500` and
`idle_timeout: 500` in all three configs, inherited from the `loco new`
scaffold. At those values the two defeat each other: half a second of idleness
reaps the pool, and half a second is not long enough to reopen connections
while the machine is busy. The failure does not look like a slow request. The
pool timeout is raised by the JWT lookup, *before* the handler runs, so Loco
maps it to HTTP 500 and a load spike reads to the client as a broken server:

```
ERROR loco_rs::controller::extractor::auth: database error during authentication
      context="jwt" error=Failed to acquire connection from pool:
      Connection pool timed out  http.uri=/api/bus/<entity>
```

It is intermittent, which is the awkward part: with an idle machine the old
values usually pass, so the symptom appears only under concurrency or
co-located load.

**Check whether you are affected:**

```bash
grep -n "^ *connect_timeout\|^ *idle_timeout" backend/config/*.yaml
```

`500` on either line in any of the three files means yes; `5000` and `30000`
mean you already have the fix. The leading `^ *` matters — without it the grep
also matches the explanatory comment that now sits above those keys, and that
comment contains the string `500ms`, so a project that is already fixed reads
as if it were not.

**Fix, in order of preference:**

1. Regenerate. The pipeline rewrites `backend/config/*.yaml`, so nothing is
   left to do by hand.
2. If you cannot regenerate, edit the three files directly — `connect_timeout:
   5000` and `idle_timeout: 30000`. Both are milliseconds.
3. Environment variables cover **development only**. `development.yaml` reads
   `DB_CONNECT_TIMEOUT` and `DB_IDLE_TIMEOUT`; `production.yaml` and
   `test.yaml` hard-code both values, so setting the variables does nothing
   there. Production is where this matters most, so do not stop at the
   variables and assume you are covered.

No migration, schema change or restart-order concern is involved — the values
are read at boot, so the change takes effect the next time the backend starts.

## Rollback Plan

If you prefer the old single-phase generation:

### Option 1: Use Previous Generator Version
```bash
git checkout <old-commit-hash> -- packages/generator/src/generators/
```

### Option 2: Manual Removal of Phase 1

Edit generator files to skip Phase 1 scaffolding:

```typescript
// In nestjs-backend.generator.ts
async generate() {
  // Comment out Phase 1
  // await this.scaffoldNestJsProject(outputDir);

  // Create directories manually (old approach)
  await this.createAdditionalDirectories(outputDir);
  // ... rest of generation
}
```

## Performance Impact

### Generation Time

```
Old (Single-Phase):
  Template rendering: ~15-30 seconds
  Total: ~15-30 seconds

New (Two-Phase):
  Phase 1 (CLI): ~2-5 minutes (first time, includes npm/bun install)
                 ~30 seconds (cached dependencies)
  Phase 2 (Templates): ~10-30 seconds
  Total: ~2-5 minutes (first time, plus 10-30s for Phase 2)
         ~40 seconds (subsequent times with cached deps)
```

### First Generation Optimization

To speed up first generation:

```bash
# Pre-install dependencies
npm install -g @nestjs/cli

# Pre-fetch TanStack Start template
bun create tanstack-start dummy --yes
rm -rf dummy

# Now generate will use cached versions
bun run generate:tanstack
```

## Testing the Migration

### Unit Tests

Run existing generator tests:
```bash
bun run test
```

Tests should cover:
- Phase 1 CLI execution
- Phase 2 template rendering
- Both phases together
- Error handling and fallbacks

### Integration Tests

Test with real ERD:

```bash
# Generate a project
bun run generate:tanstack

# Verify the output
cd generated-projects/my-project
bun install
bun run build
bun run dev
```

### E2E Tests

Test the complete flow:

```bash
# 1. Create ERD
# 2. Generate project (Phase 1 + Phase 2)
# 3. Install dependencies
# 4. Build project
# 5. Start dev server
# 6. Run Playwright E2E tests
```

## Best Practices After Migration

### 1. Version Control

Include generated projects in git to track framework versions:

```bash
git add generated-projects/
git commit -m "Generated project with two-phase generation"
```

### 2. Regular Updates

Periodically regenerate to get framework updates:

```bash
# Monthly or quarterly
bun run generate:tanstack
```

### 3. Customization

Don't modify Phase 1 output (CLI scaffold), customize Phase 2 templates instead:

```
Generated Project:
├── [Phase 1 - Don't modify]
│   ├── src/main.ts
│   ├── src/app.module.ts
│   └── ... (from nest new)
├── [Phase 2 - Safe to customize]
│   ├── src/modules/
│   ├── migrations/
│   └── ... (from templates)
└── [Merge Points]
    ├── package.json       (merge)
    ├── tsconfig.json      (can override)
    └── ... configs
```

### 4. Framework Updates

When NestJS or TanStack Start releases new versions:

1. CLI automatically uses latest (Phase 1)
2. Update templates as needed (Phase 2)
3. Regenerate projects to test compatibility

### Reporting Issues

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check CLI availability:**
   ```bash
   nest --version
   bun --version
   ```

2. **Reproduce with clean generation:**
   ```bash
   rm -rf test-project
   bun run generate:tanstack
   ```

3. **Check error logs** from Phase 1 and Phase 2

4. **Try manual scaffolding:**
   ```bash
   nest new test --package-manager bun --skip-git
   bun create tanstack-start test --yes
   ```

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Do I need to manually run CLI commands?

A: No, the generator runs them automatically. You only need the CLI tools installed.

### Q: Can I customize CLI scaffold options?

A: Yes, edit `scaffoldNestJsProject()` and `scaffoldTanStackProject()` methods to pass different flags.

### Q: What if CLI is not installed?

A: Generator continues with manual setup (Phase 2 still works). Consider installing CLI tools for best results.

### Q: How do I use the old single-phase generator?

A: Check out an earlier version of the repository or comment out Phase 1 methods.

### Q: Can I run Phase 1 and Phase 2 separately?

A: Yes, they're independent methods. You can call them individually for custom workflows.

### Q: Will generated projects be compatible with my existing stack?

A: Yes, Phase 2 templates are backward compatible. Only Phase 1 changes the base structure.
