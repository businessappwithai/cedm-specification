/**
 * The spec and the code that logs against it, held together.
 *
 * Without this, the two drift in the one direction nobody notices. A call site
 * naming an event id that no longer exists still compiles — event ids are
 * strings, deliberately, so the spec can be edited without a codegen step — and
 * at runtime it degrades to a `logSpecViolation` warning. That is the right
 * behaviour in production and the wrong thing to discover there.
 *
 * So the check is here instead: every `log.event("…")` in the repository names
 * an event the spec declares, and every event the spec declares is reachable
 * from somewhere. The second half is what stops the catalogue turning into a
 * wishlist of events nothing emits.
