/**
 * Derive a reporting pack from an EML model.
 *
 *   bun build/reporting-pack.ts -i <model.eml.mmd> -o <pack.json> --database <db>
 *
 * The reporting platform stores reports, charts and dashboards as definitions
 * over saved SQL queries, and holds roles deciding which of a data source's
 * tables a reporting user may read. A pack is exactly those definitions, so a
 * generated application arrives with a reporting layer built for *its* entities
 * rather than an empty workspace and a SQL editor.
 *
 * ## This file no longer derives anything
 *
 * It used to, in about eight hundred lines. The derivation now lives in
 * `app-with-ai-rust`'s generator — `packages/generator/src/reporting/pack.ts`,
 * carried there from `app-with-ai-tanstack` unchanged apart from where it takes
 * table names from (the Loco `m0002_bus_tables` migration's own derivation) —
 * and this is a CLI over it.
 *
 * That is a move rather than a rewrite, and the reason is that the pack
 * acquired two more readers. The generated application's own browser build
 * serves the same reports behind its own sign-in, and the full-stack project it
 * writes ships the pack in a `reporting/` directory for the platform its
 * compose file starts. Three derivations would be three answers to "what
 * reports does this model have", and the first time any of them changed the
 * products would disagree about a model in front of a reader.
 *
 * Reaching across the repository boundary is what this repository already does
 * for `compileRbac`, `deriveAccess` and `compileWorkflows` — for the same
 * reason and through the same checkout. The direction of the dependency is the
 * point: the generator writes the applications, so the generator owns what a
 * model means.
 *
 * What stayed here is what belongs to *this* repository: the CLI, the
 * diagnostics gate, and `docker compose`'s idea of where a pack goes.
 *
 * Every derived query is still traceable to something the model declares — an
 * entity earns a register, an `%%enum` a breakdown, `created_at` a volume line,
 * a `kind: state` workflow a lifecycle, numeric columns a measures report, a
 * `oneToMany` children-per-parent, and a `%%report` the question its author
 * wrote. See the module named above; `scripts/check-reporting-pack.ts` is what
 * runs the result against a real PostgreSQL.
