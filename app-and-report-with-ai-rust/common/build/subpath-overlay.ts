/**
 * Put a TanStack Start application on a URL sub-path.
 *
 * Both applications here are served from one origin — the generated one under
 * `/app`, the reporting one under `/report` — and neither was written to live
 * anywhere but the root of a host. Three things have to agree for that to work,
 * and getting one of them wrong produces a blank page rather than an error:
 *
 *   1. the bundler's `base`, so the HTML asks for `/report/assets/x.js` rather
 *      than `/assets/x.js`
 *   2. the router's `basepath`, so a client-side link is built as
 *      `/report/dashboard` and an incoming `/report/dashboard` still matches
 *      the `/dashboard` route
 *   3. any hand-written static-file server in front of the app, which maps a
 *      URL path to a file on disk and will not find `assets/x.js` under a
 *      directory it was told is `/report/assets/x.js`
 *
 * The prefix is deliberately *not* stripped by the proxy in front. Stripping it
 * would satisfy (3) for free and then break (2): the server would receive
 * `/dashboard` while every link the router writes says `/report/dashboard`.
 *
 * Applied to a *copy*: the generated application's output, which this project
 * owns, and the reporting application's source inside its image at build time.
 * Neither checked-in project is modified.
 *
 *   bun build/subpath-overlay.ts --dir <appRoot> --base /report
 *
 * Idempotent — a second run over an already-patched tree changes nothing and
 * says so, because the image build and the local generate both run it.

  // at the server root through Nitro. Setting Vite's `base` rewrote *some*
  // emitted URLs and moved no files and did not touch the `_build` router at

  //                               because nothing is on disk at that path

/**
 * Rewrite the application's own root-absolute `"/api/…"` literals to sit
 * under the prefix.
 *
 * This is the step that only running the two applications together revealed,
 * and the one without which path-based co-hosting cannot work at all.
 *
 * Vite's `base` rewrites asset URLs. The router's `basepath` rewrites links and
 * route matching. Neither touches a request URL written as a string literal in
 * source — and both applications here call their API that way, root-absolute:
 * 174 call sites in the reporting application, 7 in the generated one. Served
 * side by side they both ask for `/api/...` on the same origin, and no proxy
 * can send one path to two upstreams.
 *
 * So the application that *can* be moved is moved.
 *
 * The rule is "every root-absolute `/api/` literal except a route definition",
 * and it is stated that way round after the narrower one failed. Anchoring on
 * `fetch(` looked safe and missed most of them, because a request URL is very
 * often not written inside the `fetch(` call:
 *
 *     const url = chartId === "new" ? "/api/charts" : `/api/charts/${chartId}`
 *     const url = new URL(`/api/charts/${chartId}/data`, location.origin)
 *     ...createSyncOptions("/api/sync/reports")
 *     downloadUrl: `/api/report-generation/artifacts/${id}?download=true`
 *     <CopilotKit runtimeUrl="/api/copilotkit">
 *
 * Every one of those is a request that leaves the browser for `/api/…` on a
 * shared origin, which the proxy hands to the *other* application. The
 * CopilotKit ones are how this was found: the reporting platform's assistant
 * was asking the generated application's backend for a completion.
 *
 * `createFileRoute("/api/…")` and `createAPIFileRoute("/api/…")` are the
 * exception, and the only one: those are route *definitions*, which the router
 * already prefixes with its basepath when it matches a request. Rewriting them
 * too would double the prefix.
 *
 * The other application keeps the root, and the proxy routes `/api/` there —
 * see common/docker/nginx/default.conf.
