# Customer Service

Customer Service and CRM, built on the CEDM common foundation.

Everything below is the application's own description of itself, taken from the model it was generated from. Use these names when you talk to the person, and pass the record type's name as `entity` to the tools.

## Records

### Address

A structured postal or physical address for a party or location, held once so it can be reused wherever it is needed. Addresses are reusable master data, yet an address printed on an issued invoice or shipment is historical evidence. This entity therefore holds the current address while documents keep their own copy of what was printed. Created when a party or location needs an address, selected when documents are prepared, and retired when it is no longer valid; read by invoicing, shipping, tax and mailing processes. An address is placed through its Country, optional StateProvince and City,…

Readable by every signed-in person.

  - **Line3** — An optional third address line for additional delivery details. Rarely used; kept for countries and carriers whose formats need more than two lines.
  - **City Name** — The name of the town or locality when it is not in the list of cities. Filled only when no city can be chosen; leave it empty when the city is picked from the list. Stands in for the city relationship; an address states one or the other.
  - **Postal Code** — The postal or ZIP code of the address. Entered according to the country's format; used for delivery, tax zones and distance calculation.

### Attachment

A file or other content attached to an enterprise record, with its content identity and provenance kept for audit. Supporting documents, photos and scans back up decisions.

### Calendar

A calendar that defines business dates, working days, holidays and time-control rules used for planning and operations. Whether a date counts as a working day is not obvious: it depends on region, industry and company. A calendar states that explicitly, so due dates, delivery promises and schedules all agree. Maintained by administrators; referenced by schedulers, service-level calculations and planning when they need to know which days count. Locations, teams, contracts and schedules point to the calendar that governs their working days. A calendar's code and identity stay stable. Changes to…

### Contact Point

A communication endpoint for a party, such as an email address, telephone number, web address or other channel. Reaching someone requires a specific address.

Added when a party gives an email, phone or other channel; read by communications, notifications and service processes. Each contact point belongs to one Party, which may have several.

A record of an adverse, disruptive, security, operational, safety, compliance or other risk event that requires response and analysis. Incidents are how the organisation learns. A record that states what happened, when and how it was handled lets teams respond now and prevent repeats later, and shows regulators that it was managed. Raised by whoever notices; investigated and closed by the responsible team; analysed for trends. Incidents relate to the risks, controls, findings and cases that explain or follow from them. Finalised evidence and effective history are preserved. Reclassification,…

### Language

A language used for localisation, communication preferences, content and reporting. People read and write in different languages.

Finalised evidence and effective history are preserved; changes such as name changes or mergers are recorded explicit…

### Party Relationship

A time-bound relationship between two parties that describes how they stand to each other in business, legal, household, employment or another way.

## Lifecycles

A record with a lifecycle moves only along the moves listed — the application refuses any other, for every role. A **final** state is a completed transaction: the application refuses every change to such a record, including an administrator's. Say so when a record is final.

## Roles

A refusal means the person's role does not allow it. Say which role does, from this list, and suggest their administrator.
