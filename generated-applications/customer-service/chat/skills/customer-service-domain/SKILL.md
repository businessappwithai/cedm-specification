# Customer Service

## Records

### Address

A structured postal or physical address for a party or location, held once so it can be reused wherever it is needed. Addresses are reusable master data, yet an address printed on an issued invoice or shipment is historical evidence. This entity therefore holds the current address while documents keep their own copy of what was printed. Created when a party or location needs an address, selected when documents are prepared, and retired when it is no longer valid; read by invoicing, shipping, tax and mailing processes. An address is placed through its Country, optional StateProvince and City,…

  - **City Name** — The name of the town or locality when it is not in the list of cities. Filled only when no city can be chosen; leave it empty when the city is picked from the list. Stands in for the city relationship; an address states one or the other.
  - **Postal Code** — The postal or ZIP code of the address. Entered according to the country's format; used for delivery, tax zones and distance calculation.
  - **Latitude** — The north-south position of the address on the earth in decimal degrees, from -90 to 90. Optional; filled by geocoding for mapping and routing. Must stay within -90 to 90.

Maintained by administrators; referenced by schedulers, service-level calculations and planning when they need to know which days count.

A communication endpoint for a party, such as an email address, telephone number, web address or other channel. Reaching someone requires a specific address.

### Legal Entity

A legally recognised organisation or person that can hold rights and obligations, registrations, contracts, assets, liabilities or filings. Contracts are signed and taxes are paid by legal entities, not by business units. Knowing exactly which entity is involved determines liability, reporting and registration duties. Registered when an entity is formed or acquired; referenced by contracts, filings and ledgers. Contracts, filings and accounting books refer to the legal entity. Finalised evidence and effective history are preserved; changes such as name changes or mergers are recorded explicit…

Fields:
  - **Occurred At** — When the entity was formed, or its record took effect. Set from the registration data.

### Location

A physical or logical place where resources, activities, stock, services or organisational operations are situated. Almost everything in a business happens somewhere. The location is the shared reference for that: sites, warehouses, stores, offices, ports and even virtual places, arranged in a hierarchy so addresses, stock and assets can all point to the same place. Created when a place becomes relevant; arranged under parent locations; referenced by assets, stock, facilities and addresses; read by logistics, facilities and reporting. A location may sit within a parent Location with children…

### Organization

Party identifies who the organization is; Organization describes intrinsic organizational structure; PartyRole describes how it participates; Customer and Supplier provide commercial behavior. Used across sales, procurement, finance, logistics, contracts, compliance, HR, and enterprise hierarchy. Party → Organization provides identity specialization. Party → PartyRole provides participation. Customer/Supplier must not create duplicate Party identities. Create/maintain Party → create…

### Party

The foundational CEDM business concept for an identifiable person or organization participating in business. Party separates who an actor is from the roles that actor performs. The same party can be a customer, supplier, employee, owner, provider, or contract party without creating duplicate identities. Used as the identity foundation for onboarding, customer management, procurement, sales, finance, logistics, HR, healthcare, contracts, compliance, and audit.

### Party Relationship

A time-bound relationship between two parties that describes how they stand to each other in business, legal, household, employment or another way. Parties are connected to each other: a company to its subsidiary, a person to their employer, one household member to another. Recording the relationship, with its dates, lets the organisation see who is connected to whom and since when. Created when a relationship is established; ended when it stops; read by sales, compliance and customer service. A relationship runs from one Party to another. Code and identity stay stable, and the relationship's…

Party answers who the actor is; PartyRole answers how that actor participates; Customer and Supplier add role-specific commercial behavior. Foundation for sales, procurement, employment, logistics, ownership, contracts, finance, and relationship management. Customer and Supplier specialize PartyRole. Party identity is never duplicated in those specializations. Transaction entities should retain the role context that was effective when the transaction was created or confirmed. Party onboarding → PartyRole creation…
