## Records

### Address

A structured postal or physical address for a party or location, held once so it can be reused wherever it is needed. Addresses are reusable master data, yet an address printed on an issued invoice or shipment is historical evidence. This entity therefore holds the current address while documents keep their own copy of what was printed. Created when a party or location needs an address, selected when documents are prepared, and retired when it is no longer valid; read by invoicing, shipping, tax and mailing processes. An address is placed through its Country, optional StateProvince and City,…

Readable by every signed-in person.

  - **Line3** — An optional third address line for additional delivery details. Rarely used; kept for countries and carriers whose formats need more than two lines.
  - **City Name** — The name of the town or locality when it is not in the list of cities. Filled only when no city can be chosen; leave it empty when the city is picked from the list. Stands in for the city relationship; an address states one or the other.
  - **Postal Code** — The postal or ZIP code of the address. Entered according to the country's format; used for delivery, tax zones and distance calculation.

### Attachment

A file or other content attached to an enterprise record, with its content identity and provenance kept for audit. Supporting documents, photos and scans back up decisions.

Added when a user or system attaches evidence to a record; read when someone needs to see or verify the supporting document. An attachment is linked to the record it supports; the same file may be attached to more than one. Once attached, the content is evide…

They let results, budgets and responsibility be assigned to a meaningful segment rather than to the organisation as a whole.

### Calendar

A calendar that defines business dates, working days, holidays and time-control rules used for planning and operations. Whether a date counts as a working day is not obvious: it depends on region, industry and company. A calendar states that explicitly, so due dates, delivery promises and schedules all agree. Maintained by administrators; referenced by schedulers, service-level calculations and planning when they need to know which days count. Locations, teams, contracts and schedules point to the calendar that governs their working days. A calendar's code and identity stay stable. Changes to…

A carrier record identifies that provider and gives bookings, tracking and freight invoices a single party to refer to. Created when a transport provider is approved for use; selected when shipments are booked; read for service performance and freight costs. A carrier is a Party acting in the transport role; shipments and consignments are assigned to it. Changes and retries preserve history, and a carrier's past shipments remain linked to it after it stops being…

Created when goods are tendered to a carrier; tracked until delivery; read for status, proof of delivery and freight charges. A consignment is carried by a Carrier and contains one or more shipments.

The record that shipped goods were handed over to a destination or recipient. A shipment is not finished when it leaves; it is finished when someone receives it. The delivery is the proof of that handover, which settles disputes and triggers invoicing. Created when the carrier confirms handover; read by customer service, finance and claims.

Opened when an order is released for fulfilment; updated as each step completes; read by customer service and warehouse supervisors. Fulfilment follows the sales demand and links to the reservations, shipments and deliveries that carry it out. Changes and retries prese…

An endpoint record names one such channel and how it is used, so that deliveries can be routed, retried and audited against a known destination. Registered when a connection to another system is set up; referenced by delivery attempts; read by integration operators when diagnosing failures. Delivery attempts target an endpoint, and messages are routed to it by subscription. Delivery retries and corrections keep audita…
