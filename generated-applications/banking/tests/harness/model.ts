/**
 * What the model declared — as data.
 *
 * `entities.ts` describes the *shape* the suites have to build payloads for.
 * This file is the other half: the values a column is allowed to hold and the
 * states a record is allowed to move between, taken straight from the enums
 * and state machines of the source model.
 *
 * The distinction matters. A suite that reads the running application's
 * dictionary and then asserts against that same dictionary proves only that
 * the application is self-consistent — it passes just as happily when the
 * generator dropped a value on the floor. Everything here is the model's own
 * word, so a dropdown that lost an option or a state machine that lost an edge
 * fails a test instead of quietly shipping.
