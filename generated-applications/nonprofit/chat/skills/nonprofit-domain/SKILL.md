## Records

### Address

A structured postal or physical address for a party or location, held once so it can be reused wherever it is needed. Addresses are reusable master data, yet an address printed on an issued invoice or shipment is historical evidence. This entity therefore holds the current address while documents keep their own copy of what was printed. Created when a party or location needs an address, selected when documents are prepared, and retired when it is no longer valid; read by invoicing, shipping, tax and mailing processes. An address is placed through its Country, optional StateProvince and City,…

  - **Line3** — An optional third address line for additional delivery details. Rarely used; kept for countries and carriers whose formats need more than two lines.
  - **City Name** — The name of the town or locality when it is not in the list of cities. Filled only when no city can be chosen; leave it empty when the city is picked from the list. Stands in for the city relationship; an address states one or the other.
  - **Postal Code** — The postal or ZIP code of the address. Entered according to the country's format; used for delivery, tax zones and distance calculation.
  - **Latitude** — The north-south position of the address on the earth in decimal degrees, from -90 to 90. Optional; filled by geocoding for mapping and routing. Must stay within -90 to 90.

### Calendar

A calendar that defines business dates, working days, holidays and time-control rules used for planning and operations. Whether a date counts as a working day is not obvious: it depends on region, industry and company. A calendar states that explicitly, so due dates, delivery promises and schedules all agree. Maintained by administrators; referenced by schedulers, service-level calculations and planning when they need to know which days count. Locations, teams, contracts and schedules point to the calendar that governs their working days. A calendar's code and identity stay stable. Changes to…

Added when a party gives an email, phone or other channel; read by communications, notifications and service processes. Each contact point belongs to one Party, which may have several.

### Party Relationship

A time-bound relationship between two parties that describes how they stand to each other in business, legal, household, employment or another way.

Recording the relationship, with its dates, lets the organisation see who is connected to whom and since when. Created when a relationship is established; ended when it stops; read by sales, compliance and customer service. A relationship runs from one Party to another.

Foundation for sales, procurement, employment, logistics, ownership, contracts, finance, and relationship management. Customer and Supplier specialize PartyRole. Party identity is never duplicated in those specializations. Transaction entities should retain the role context that was effective when the transaction was created or confirmed.

- **RETIRED** — No longer used; kept for history. A final state.

## Lifecycles

A record with a lifecycle moves only along the moves listed — the application refuses any other, for every role. A **final** state is a completed transaction: the application refuses every change to such a record, including an administrator's. Say so when a record is final.

## Roles

- **Administrator** — reads and changes everything the lifecycles allow

A refusal means the person's role does not allow it. Say which role does, from this list, and suggest their administrator.
